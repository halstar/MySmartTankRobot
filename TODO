What could be done next?

=> Add some code comments,
=> Add some robustness around,
=> Read IMU via interrupt/FIFOs mechanism, instead of using polling mechanism,
=> Make I2C, IMU, etc. classes more generic, so that they could easily be reused by other projects,
=> Integrate IMU & motors calibration into robot.py's debug console, in order to have a single entry point,
