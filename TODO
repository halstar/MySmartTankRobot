What could be done next?...

* Add some code comments,
* Add some robustness around,
* Read IMU via interrupt/FIFOs mechanism, instead of using polling mechanism,
* Make I2C, IMU, etc. classes more generic, so that they could easily be reused by other projects,
* Integrate IMU & motors calibration into robot.py's debug console, in order to have a single entry point,
* Integrate a moved distance measurement, through the use of motors encoder, and integrate this data to improve all modes.
