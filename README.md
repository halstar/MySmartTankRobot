# MySmartTankRobot

A homemade smart tank robot built on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ basis, with different regular sensors (IMU, ultrasonic), and a camera.

This repository gathers sources Python scripts to be executed on the Raspberry Pi.

**Note**:  gpiozero & pigpio supports were partially tested. For the latter, the following commands might help!

* sudo pip3 install pigpio

* sudo pigpiod
